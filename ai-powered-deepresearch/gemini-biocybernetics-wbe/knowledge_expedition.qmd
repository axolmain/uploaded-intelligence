    * **Systems Biology:** The International Conference on Computational Methods in Systems Biology (CMSB) is a well-established annual conference.[63]
    * **AI and Brain-Inspired AI:** Conferences like the International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP) sometimes host special sessions relevant to brain-inspired AI and WBE, such as the "Toward Safe Brain-Inspired AI" session organized in collaboration with the Whole Brain Architecture Initiative.[56]
    * **General Neuroscience/Biomedical Engineering:** Large conferences like the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) annual meeting, while broad, have significant computational and neural engineering components.

* **Workshops:** Workshops are often associated with major conferences or organized independently by research institutions and foundations. These provide focused environments for discussing specific problems and emerging ideas. Examples include the Mimir Center's workshop on the Philosophy and Ethics of Brain Emulation [53] and various workshops hosted by the Carboncopies Foundation.[52]

* **Societies and Organizations:** Joining or following relevant professional societies can provide access to resources, networking opportunities, and updates.
    * Organization for Computational Neurosciences (OCNS).[59]
    * IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS).[61]
