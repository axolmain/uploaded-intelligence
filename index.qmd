title: "What's this for?"
---

This is my personal research website where I put my notes on neuromorphic computing, brain emulation, and other related topics. Basically I watched [Pantheon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11680642/) and thought it was really cool so I want to upload myself and becoming smart seems like a good start.

I'm a software engineer with a academic background in Computer Science and Data Science, so who knows if this will go anywhere - but I'm pretty sure that's the point of researching things (to learn).

### Disclaimer
Since AI is so big right now, I'm going to be using it a lot in research, but to keep my thoughts separate from AI's thoughts, I'll be keeping my research separate from AI's research.
